## About

VidUI is the premier GUI for the video creators of Gamer Robot's Elemental Battleground on Roblox! It's the exploit that's not an exploit, and will let you view the action without hassle!

## Disclaimer

**EarthToAccess and VidUI's contributors take no responsibility for the misuse or VidUI or it's features.** Using any user interface such as this in any unintended or malicious manner may result in your account being banned from Elemental Battlegrounds or Roblox.

**Looking for something more useful?** If you're looking for the all-in-one UI to enhance your gameplay in Elemental Battlegrounds, check out VidUI's sister project [EBGui](https://github.com/EarthToAccess/EBGui) instead!

## Terms and Conditions

You can view the Terms and Conditions for using VidUI [at this link.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qLJqaVDGmreg5xAgqxvFeVPghS-YcuUUu355M5BJkM/edit?usp=sharing) Please note that, in using the script, you will be bound by these terms.

## Loading

To use VidUI, you're going to need an executor, such as [Synapse](https://x.synapse.to) or [Script-Ware](https://script-ware.com), which are paid, or [Krnl](https://krnl.vip/), which is free. Once you have that, there are two versions you can use.

To use the Stable version, utilize the loadstring below;

  ```lua
  loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EarthToAccess/VidUI/main/stable.lua'))()
  ```

To use the less-stable, yet more consistently updated Canary version, use this loadstring;

  ```lua
  loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EarthToAccess/VidUI/main/canary.lua'))()
  ```

Canary will have early access to new features, but may break sometimes. Use it at your own risk!

## Features

Features of VidUI include, but absolutely are not limited to;

- Camera switching between provided competitors
- Ease-to-use enhanced ESP to see everyone's status
- A safe place for your character to stay while viewing

This list is not comprehensive; there is so much more in store for you to find!

## Contributions and Rights

It's recommended you [open an issue](https://github.com/EarthToAccess/VidUI/issues), as problems may be fixed, features may be planned, and so on and so forth behind the scenes. Opening an issue also makes issues, features, and so on easier to track. Pull requests will be ignored; however, if you open an issue and your bug gets fixed/feature gets added, you'll be added to the UI's internal credits.

Any UIs based on VidUI should be accredited to EarthToAccess, and repositories that use VidUI's code should have a direct link to this one.
